# Retro Revival – AI Assisted Minesweeper

This project is a modern-retro reimagination of the classic Minesweeper game,
built as part of the **Retro Revival (Week 4)** challenge using **Kiro IDE**.

The game combines nostalgic gameplay with a helpful AI assistant that suggests
safe moves without playing the game for the user.
