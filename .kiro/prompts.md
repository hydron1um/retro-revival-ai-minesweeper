# Retro Revival – AI Assisted Minesweeper

Goal:
Rebuild a classic Minesweeper game from scratch using Kiro IDE
as part of the Retro Revival challenge.

Key Instructions Given to Kiro:
- Implement Minesweeper with correct reveal logic
- First click is always safe
- Support 4x4, 6x6, and 9x9 grid modes
- Add an AI Hint system that suggests a safe tile
- AI must not reveal tiles or change game state
- Fix auto-reveal and recursion bugs
- Add live timer and mine counter
- Design a modern retro, Mario-inspired UI
- Ensure restart and grid switching work correctly

Outcome:
Kiro was used to rapidly generate, debug, and refine the game
logic, AI reasoning, and UI structure.
